# Audio Visualizer for Arduino UNO

The system is an audio/music visualizer system. Audio is fed into one Arduino via audio jack from an Alexa, or any other audio system that outputs to an audio jack. The audio data is then sent via a serial wired connection to another Arduino. Data is processed by the next Arduino for the parameters of the LED matrix. The LED Matrix displays an accompanying visualization for the received audio data. Additional visualization modes, colors, and additional settings are toggled through push buttons.
